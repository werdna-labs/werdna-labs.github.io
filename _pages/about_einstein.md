I'm a network engineer for [HPE Aruba Networking](https://www.arubanetworks.com/). Previously, I worked in the partner/VAR space. I obtained a BSc in Physics at Western Michigan University where I attended as a Medallion Scholar, the highest academic based scholarship. This website is primarily a place to document my own lab, write quick and dirty guides, and to point people to things I think are neat like this here official [VSG](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/VSG/).  

I also may occasionally link things hobby related: guitar, development, reading, gaming
